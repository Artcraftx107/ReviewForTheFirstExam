You'll define an interface called PaymentProcessor, and then implement this interface in two different classes: CreditCardProcessor and PaypalProcessor.

Interface: PaymentProcessor
The PaymentProcessor interface will declare a method processPayment(double amount) which, when implemented, processes a payment of the specified amount.

Class 1: CreditCardProcessor
The CreditCardProcessor class will implement the PaymentProcessor interface and provide an implementation for the processPayment(double amount) method that simulates processing a payment using a credit card.

Class 2: PaypalProcessor
The PaypalProcessor class will also implement the PaymentProcessor interface. It will provide its own implementation of the processPayment(double amount) method that simulates processing a payment using PayPal.

Your Task
Define the PaymentProcessor interface.
Implement the PaymentProcessor interface in the CreditCardProcessor class.
Implement the PaymentProcessor interface in the PaypalProcessor class.
In a Main class, create instances of both CreditCardProcessor and PaypalProcessor and use them to process payments.
